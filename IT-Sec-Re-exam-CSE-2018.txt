(1.A) What is a Certificate? Which components does it contain?
	- Certificate is the electronic document to authentitatively the digital signature of the owner
	- Identity of subject, public key of subject, digital signature of issuer

(1.B) What is a Certificate Authority and what does it do exactly?
	- the entity which stores, signs, and issues digital certificates
	- acts as a trusted third party by the owner of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate

(1.C) In an X.509 Certificate, how do I recognize a Root Cerfiticate?
	- issuer = subject

(1.D) Name two advantages of using Certificates.
	- authenticity, integrity, nonrepudiation

(1.E) What is Certificate Revocation and when do I need it? How can a user find out if a Certificate was revoked?
	- List of digital certificates have been revoked
	- How to check:	
		+ Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
			. download whole CRL database
			. loop through it to check 
			. if cannot download CRL => trust the certificate
		+ Online Cerrtificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
		+ Online Cerrtificate Status Protocol Stapling
			. at regular interval, seb server contact OCSP responder to check status of a certificate 
			. OCSP responder sends back timestamp signed by CA
			. When client want to connect to the server, the server sends the timestamp with certificate during the SSL/TLS handshake
			
(1.F) What is OCSP, how does it work and why is it needed?	
	- Online Certificate Status Protocol works
		+ web server sends its certificate to the client
		+ web client concerned that the certificate may have been revoked, creates an OCSP request to the CA
		+ OCSP responder uses the certificate serial number to check status and responds with values:
			. good
			. revoked
			. unknown
		+ The CA responder keeps frequent updates with CRL server to make sure to list is current
	- Why need it		
		- Faster than Certificate Revocation List
		- Reducing overhead and burden on the client <= still huge burden on client
	
(1.G) What is a Certificate Signing Request? Which keys of the subject does the Signing Request contain?

	- Network Address Translation
	
(3.N) Where would you typically place a server in a company network which must be reachable from the public Internet?
